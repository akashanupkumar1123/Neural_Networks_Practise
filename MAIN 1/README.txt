 Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition, Multiclass


ReLU Activation
This week, a new activation was introduced, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).
𝑎=𝑚𝑎𝑥(0,𝑧)# ReLU function

Canvas(toolbar=Toolbar(toolitems=[('Home', 'Reset original view', 'home', 'home'), ('Back', 'Back to previous …
The example from the lecture on the right shows an application of the ReLU. In this example, the derived "awareness" feature is not binary but has a continuous range of values. The sigmoid is best for on/off or binary situations. The ReLU provides a continuous linear relationship. Additionally it has an 'off' range where the output is zero. The "off" feature makes the ReLU a Non-Linear activation. Why is this needed? This enables multiple units to contribute to to the resulting function without interfering.



Softmax Function
A multiclass neural network generates N outputs. One output is selected as the predicted answer. In the output layer, a vector  𝐳  is generated by a linear function which is fed into a softmax function. The softmax function converts  𝐳  into a probability distribution as described below. After applying softmax, each output will be between 0 and 1 and the outputs will sum to 1. They can be interpreted as probabilities. The larger inputs to the softmax will correspond to larger output probabilities.


The softmax function can be written:
𝑎𝑗=𝑒𝑧𝑗∑𝑁−1𝑘=0𝑒𝑧𝑘(1)
Where 𝑧=𝐰⋅𝐱+𝑏 and N is the number of feature/categories in the output layer.


Neural Networks
In last weeks assignment, you implemented a neural network to do binary classification. This week you will extend that to multiclass classification. This will utilize the softmax activation.


4.1 Problem Statement
In this exercise, you will use a neural network to recognize ten handwritten digits, 0-9. This is a multiclass classification task where one of n choices is selected. Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks.


4.2 Dataset
You will start by loading the dataset for this task.

The load_data() function shown below loads the data into variables X and y
The data set contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits  1 .

Each training example is a 20-pixel x 20-pixel grayscale image of the digit.
Each pixel is represented by a floating-point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location.
The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is “unrolled” into a 400-dimensional vector.
Each training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix X.
This gives us a 5000 x 400 matrix X where every row is a training example of a handwritten digit image.
𝑋=−−−(𝑥(1))−−−−−−(𝑥(2))−−−⋮−−−(𝑥(𝑚))−−−
 
The second part of the training set is a 5000 x 1 dimensional vector y that contains labels for the training set
y = 0 if the image is of the digit 0, y = 4 if the image is of the digit 4 and so on.

View the variables
Let's get more familiar with your dataset.

A good place to start is to print out each variable and see what it contains.


Check the dimensions of your variables
Another way to get familiar with your data is to view its dimensions. Please print the shape of X and y and see how many training examples you have in your dataset.


Visualizing the Data
You will begin by visualizing a subset of the training set.

In the cell below, the code randomly selects 64 rows from X, maps each row back to a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image and displays the images together.
The label for each image is displayed above the image


Model representation
The neural network you will use in this assignment is shown in the figure below.

This has two dense layers with ReLU activations followed by an output layer with a linear activation.
Recall that our inputs are pixel values of digit images.
Since the images are of size  20×20 , this gives us  400  inputs


The parameters have dimensions that are sized for a neural network with  25  units in layer 1,  15  units in layer 2 and  10  output units in layer 3, one for each digit.

Recall that the dimensions of these parameters is determined as follows:

If network has  𝑠𝑖𝑛  units in a layer and  𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑡  units in the next layer, then
𝑊  will be of dimension  𝑠𝑖𝑛×𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑡 .
𝑏  will be a vector with  𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑡  elements
Therefore, the shapes of W, and b, are

layer1: The shape of W1 is (400, 25) and the shape of b1 is (25,)
layer2: The shape of W2 is (25, 15) and the shape of b2 is: (15,)
layer3: The shape of W3 is (15, 10) and the shape of b3 is: (10,)
Note: The bias vector b could be represented as a 1-D (n,) or 2-D (n,1) array. Tensorflow utilizes a 1-D representation and this lab will maintain that convention


Tensorflow Model Implementation
Tensorflow models are built layer by layer. A layer's input dimensions (𝑠𝑖𝑛 above) are calculated for you. You specify a layer's output dimensions and this determines the next layer's input dimension. The input dimension of the first layer is derived from the size of the input data specified in the model.fit statement below.

Note: It is also possible to add an input layer that specifies the input dimension of the first layer. For example:
tf.keras.Input(shape=(400,)),    #specify input shape
We will include that here to illuminate some model sizing.

Softmax placement
As described in the lecture and the optional softmax lab, numerical stability is improved if the softmax is grouped with the loss function rather than the output layer during training. This has implications when building the model and using the model.
Building:

The final Dense layer should use a 'linear' activation. This is effectively no activation.
The model.compile statement will indicate this by including from_logits=True. loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
This does not impact the form of the target. In the case of SparseCategorialCrossentropy, the target is the expected digit, 0-9.
Using the model:

The outputs are not probabilities. If output probabilities are desired, apply a softmax function.




The parameter counts shown in the summary correspond to the number of elements in the weight and bias arrays as shown below.

Let's further examine the weights to verify that tensorflow produced the same dimensions as we calculated above.



defines a loss function, SparseCategoricalCrossentropy and indicates the softmax should be included with the loss calculation by adding from_logits=True)
defines an optimizer. A popular choice is Adaptive Moment (Adam) which was described in lecture.

Epochs and batches
In the compile statement above, the number of epochs was set to 100. This specifies that the entire data set should be applied during training 100 times. During training, you see output describing the progress of training that looks like this:

Epoch 1/100
157/157 [==============================] - 0s 1ms/step - loss: 2.2770
The first line, Epoch 1/100, describes which epoch the model is currently running. For efficiency, the training data set is broken into 'batches'. The default size of a batch in Tensorflow is 32. There are 5000 examples in our data set or roughly 157 batches. The notation on the 2nd line 157/157 [==== is describing which batch has been executed.

Loss (cost)
In course 1, we learned to track the progress of gradient descent by monitoring the cost. Ideally, the cost will decrease as the number of iterations of the algorithm increases. Tensorflow refers to the cost as loss. Above, you saw the loss displayed each epoch as model.fit was executing. The .fit method returns a variety of metrics including the loss. This is captured in the history variable above. This can be used to examine the loss in a plot as shown below.
